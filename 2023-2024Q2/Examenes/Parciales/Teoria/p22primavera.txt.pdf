-Insert your answers on the dotted lines ... below, and only there.
-Do NOT modify the problems or the @nota lines.
-When finished, upload this file with the same name: exam.txt
-Use the text symbols:     &     v    -       ->          |=        A       E
   for                    AND   OR   NOT   IMPLIES   "SATISFIES"  FORALL  EXISTS  etc.,  like in:
   I  |=  p & (q v -r)     (the interpretation I satisfies the formula p & (q v -r)  ).
   You can write subindices using "_". For example write x_i to denote x-sub-i.

Problem 1. (4 points).                                   @n@nota1:


1a)
Let F and G be propositional formulas such that G |= F.  Is it true that then always  F |= G  or  F |= -G ?
Prove it as simply as you can using only the definitions of propositional logic.

...

1b)
Let F and G be propositional formulas.
Is it true that F |= G iff  F & -G  is unsatisfiable?
Prove it using only the definitions of propositional logic.

Problem 2. (3 points).                                   @n@nota2:


2a) Explain in a few words why propositional SAT is in NP.

...


2b) Explain in a few words why 3-SAT is NP-complete. You may assume that SAT is NP-hard.

...


2c) Let F be an UNsatisfiable propositional formula built over n different predicate symbols.
Give the name of some method to express a proof (or certificate) of unsatisfiability (like a model is a 
certificate of satisfiability).
Do you think that every unsatisfiable F has such an unsatisfiability proof of size polynomial in n?

...

Problem 3. (2 points).                                   @n@nota3:
Here just give the answer, giving no explanations. Use a^b to denote "a to the power b".


3a)
How many Boolean functions with n input bits f: {0,1}^n --> {0,1} are there in terms of n?

...


3b)
Any propositional formula represents a Boolean function.
List the names of the other methods you know to represent Boolean functions.

...


3c)
Is it true that two formulas F and G are logically equivalent iff they represent the same Boolean function?

...

Problem 4. (1 point ).                                   @n@nota4:

4) The published Sudoku puzzles usually are designed in such a way that exactly one solution exists.
Explain *very* briefly how you would use a SAT solver to check that a given Sudoku has exactly one solution.
